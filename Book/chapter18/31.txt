Transliteration:
yayā dharmam adharmaṁ cha kāryaṁ chākāryam eva chaayathāvat prajānāti buddhiḥ sā pārtha rājasī

Translation:
BG 18.31:
                            The intellect is considered in the mode of passion when it is confused between righteousness and unrighteousness, and cannot distinguish between right and wrong conduct, O Parth.

Commentary:
The rājasic intellect becomes mixed due to personal attachments. At times it sees clearly, but when self-interest comes into play, it becomes tainted and confused. For example, there are people who are very competent in their profession, but childish in familial relationships. They succeed on the career front but become utter failures on the home front because their attachment prevents them from proper perception and conduct. The rājasic intellect, colored by attachments and aversions, likes and dislikes is unable to discern the proper course of action. It becomes confused between the important and the trivial, the permanent and the transient, the valuable and the insignificant.
