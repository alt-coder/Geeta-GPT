Translation:
BG 18.70:
                            And I proclaim that those who study this sacred dialogue of ours will worship Me (with their intellect) through the sacrifice of knowledge; such is My view.

Commentary:
Shree Krishna had repeatedly told Arjun to surrender his intellect to him (verses 8.7, 12.8). This does not imply that we stop using the intellect; rather it means we utilize our intellect to the best of our ability in fulfilling his will for us. From the message of the Bhagavad Gita we understand what his will is. Hence, those who study this sacred dialogue worship God with their intellect.
