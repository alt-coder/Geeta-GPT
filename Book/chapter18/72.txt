Translation:
BG 18.72:
                            O Arjun, have you heard Me with a concentrated mind? Have your ignorance and delusion been destroyed?

Commentary:
Shree Krishna has taken the position of being Arjun’s teacher. It is natural for the teacher to inquire whether the student has grasped the subject or not. Shree Krishna’s intention of asking the question is that if Arjun has not understood, he is ready to re-explain or go into further details.
