yat tu kāmepsunā karma sāhankārena vā punaḥkriyate bahulāyāsaṁ tad rājasam udāhṛitam

Translation:
BG 18.24:
                            Action that is prompted by selfish desire, enacted with pride, and full of stress, is in the nature of passion.

Commentary:
The nature of rajo guṇa is that it creates intense desires for materialistic enhancement and sensual enjoyment. So, action in the mode of passion is motivated by huge ambition and characterized by intense effort. It entails heavy toil and great physical and mental fatigue. An example of rājasic action is the corporate world. Management executives regularly complain of stress. This is because their actions are usually motivated by pride and an inordinate ambition for power, prestige, and wealth. The efforts of political leaders, over-anxious parents, and business persons are also often typical examples of actions in the mode of passion.
