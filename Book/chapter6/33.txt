arjuna uvāchayo ’yaṁ yogas tvayā proktaḥ sāmyena madhusūdanaetasyāhaṁ na paśhyāmi chañchalatvāt sthitiṁ sthirām

Translation:
BG 6.33:
                            Arjun said: The system of Yog that you have described, O Madhusudan, appears impractical and unattainable to me, due to the restless mind.

Commentary:
Arjun speaks this verse, beginning with the words yo yam, “This system of Yog,” referring to the process described from verse 6.10 forward. Shree Krishna has just finished explaining that for perfection in Yog we must:
— subdue the senses
— give up all desires
— focus the mind upon God alone
— think of him with an unwavering mind
— see everyone with equal vision
Arjun frankly expresses his reservation about what he has heard by saying that it is impracticable. None of the above can be accomplished without controlling the mind. If the mind is restless, then all these aspects of Yog become unattainable as well.
