Translation:
BG 6.20:
                            When the mind, restrained from material activities, becomes still by the practice of Yog, then the yogi is able to behold the soul through the purified mind, and he rejoices in the inner joy.

Commentary:
Having presented the process of meditation and the state of its perfection, Shree Krishna now reveals the results of such endeavors. When the mind is purified, one is able to perceive the self as distinct from the body, mind, and intellect. For example, if there is muddy water in a glass, we cannot see through it. However, if we put alum in the water, the mud settles down and the water becomes clear. Similarly, when the mind is unclean, it obscures perception of the soul and any acquired scriptural knowledge of the ātmā is only at the theoretical level. But when the mind becomes pure, the soul is directly perceived through realization.
