Translation:
BG 5.17:
                            Those whose intellect is fixed in God, who are completely absorbed in God, with firm faith in Him as the supreme goal, such persons quickly reach the state from which there is no return, their sins having been dispelled by the light of knowledge.

Commentary:
Just as ignorance causes one to suffer in samsara, or the perpetual cycle of life and death, knowledge has the power to release one from material bondage.  Such knowledge is always accompanied with devotion to God.  This verse makes very emphatic use of words denoting complete God-consciousness.Tadbuddhayaḥ means the intellect is directed toward God.Tadātmanaḥ means the heart (mind and intellect) is solely absorbed in God.Tanniṣhṭhāḥ means the intellect has firm faith in God. Tatparāyaṇaḥ means striving after God as the supreme goal and refuge.Thus, the sign of true knowledge is that it leads to love for God.  Imbued with such love, devotees see Him everywhere. Such a divine vision is described in the next verse.
