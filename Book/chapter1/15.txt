Translation:
BG 1.15:
                            Hrishikesh blew his conch shell, called Panchajanya, and Arjun blew the Devadutta. Bheem, the voracious eater and performer of herculean tasks, blew his mighty conch, called Paundra.

Commentary:
In this verse, Shree Krishna is addressed as “Hrishikesh” which means the Lord of the mind and senses. Shree Krishna is the Sovereign Master of everybody’s minds and senses. Throughout his wonderful pastimes, he displayed complete control over his mind and senses.
