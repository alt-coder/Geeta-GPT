Translation:
BG 1.24:
                            Sanjay said: O Dhritarasthra, having thus been addressed by Arjun, the conqueror of sleep, Shree Krishna then drew the magnificent chariot between the two armies.

Commentary:
Here, Dhritarashtra is being addressed as Bhārata by Sanjay, which means, “O descendant of the great King Bharat.”
