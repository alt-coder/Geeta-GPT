Translation:
BG 1.34-35:
                            Teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, grandsons, fathers-in-law, grand-nephews, brothers-in-law, and other kinsmen are present here, staking their lives and riches. O Madhusudan, I do not wish to slay them, even if they attack me. If we kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, what satisfaction will we derive from the dominion over the three worlds, what to speak of this Earth?

Commentary:
Arjun looked at the vast gathering of warriors on the battlefield and started considering his relationships with them. His teachers, Dronacharya and Kripacharaya; grand uncle Bheeshma and Somadutta; Bhurishrava (Somdatta’s son); Kuntibhoj, Purujit, Shalya, and Shakuni his maternal uncles. The hundred Kauravas were his uncle Dhritarashra’s sons; their sons, grandsons, and several other relatives had all assembled there prepared for a battle till death.Twice in this verse, Arjun used the word api which means “even though.” He addresses Shree Krishna as Madhusudan, the killer of a demon named Madhu and says, “O Madhusudan, I do not wish to kill them even though I am aware they are eager to do so.” Again, he says, “Even though for the sake of victory over the three worlds we fight, what joy would we get by killing our own folks?”
