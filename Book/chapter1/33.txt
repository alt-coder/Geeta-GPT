Translation:
BG 1.32-33:
                            O Krishna, I do not desire victory, kingdom, or the happiness accruing to it. Of what avail will be a kingdom, pleasures, or even life itself, when the very persons for whom we covet them, are standing before us for battle?

Commentary:
Taking away someone’s life itself is immoral, and killing a relative is considered even more sinful. Arjun was in a dilemma, what would he gain with victory achieved by such a heinous act? It would not give him any joy; as he would have lost all the people who mattered to him.  Detachment to worldly assets is a commendable virtue. Even though Arjun’s thoughts were moral and virtuous, they were not spiritual sentiments. They were budding out of compassion and attachment towards his relatives. Spiritual sentiments bestow peace, harmony, and happiness to a soul. However, Arjun’s situation was not such he was disillusioned, confused, and losing control over his body and mind.
