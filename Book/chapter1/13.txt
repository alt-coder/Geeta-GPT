Translation:
BG 1.13:
                            Thereafter, conches, kettledrums, bugles, trumpets, and horns suddenly blared forth, and their combined sound was overwhelming.

Commentary:
On hearing Bheeshma’s call for battle, everyone in the Kaurava army also started playing various instruments eagerly, creating tumultuous sound. Shaṅkhāḥ means conches, paṇav are drums, ānak kettledrums, bhreyah bugles, and go-mukh are blowing horns. All these instruments playing together created a loud pandemonium.
