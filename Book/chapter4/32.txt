Transliteration:
evaṁ bahu-vidhā yajñā vitatā brahmaṇo mukhekarma-jān viddhi tān sarvān evaṁ jñātvā vimokṣhyase

Translation:
BG 4.32:
                            All these different kinds of sacrifice have been described in the Vedas. Know them as originating from different types of work; this understanding cuts the knots of material bondage.

Commentary:
One of the beautiful features of the Vedas is that they recognize and cater to the wide variety of human natures. Different kinds of sacrifice have thus been described for different kinds of performers. The common thread running through them is that they are to be done with devotion, as an offering to God. With this understanding, one is not bewildered by the multifarious instructions in the Vedas, and by pursuing the particular yajña suitable to one’s nature, one can be released from material bondage.
