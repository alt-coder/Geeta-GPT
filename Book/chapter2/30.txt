Translation:
BG 2.30:
                            O Arjun, the soul that dwells within the body is immortal; therefore, you should not mourn for anyone.

Commentary:
Often, in the course of his teachings, Shree Krishna explains a concept in a few verses, and then states a verse summarizing those teachings. This verse is a summary of the instructions on the immortality of the self, and its distinction from the body.
