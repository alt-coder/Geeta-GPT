Transliteration:
bhogaiśwvarya-prasaktānāṁ tayāpahṛita-chetasāmvyavasāyātmikā buddhiḥ samādhau na vidhīyate

Translation:
BG 2.44:
                            With their minds deeply attached to worldly pleasures and their intellects bewildered by such things, they are unable to possess the resolute determination for success on the path to God.

Commentary:
People whose minds are attached to sensual enjoyment concern themselves with bhog (gratification), and aiśhwarya (luxury). They engage their intellects in enhancing their income and contemplating how to increase their material possessions and maximize their enjoyment. Bewildered in this manner, they are unable to develop the firm resolve required for traversing the path to God-realization.
