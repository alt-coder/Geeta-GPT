Transliteration:
tad ity anabhisandhāya phalaṁ yajña-tapaḥ-kriyāḥdāna-kriyāśh cha vividhāḥ kriyante mokṣha-kāṅkṣhibhiḥ

Translation:
BG 17.25:
                            Persons who do not desire fruitive rewards, but seek to be free from material entanglements, utter the word “Tat” along with acts of austerity, sacrifice, and charity.

Commentary:
The fruits of all actions belong to God, and hence, any yajña (sacrifice), tapaḥ (austerity), and dānam (charity), must be consecrated by offering it for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. Now, Shree Krishna glorifies the sound vibration “Tat,” which refers to Brahman. Chanting Tat along with austerity, sacrifice, and charity symbolizes that they are not to be performed for material rewards, but for the eternal welfare of the soul through God-realization.
