Translation:
BG 17.15:
                            Words that do not cause distress, are truthful, inoffensive, and beneficial, as well as regular recitation of the Vedic scriptures—these are declared as austerity of speech.

Commentary:
Austerity of speech is speaking words that are truthful, unoffending, pleasing, and beneficial for the listener. The practice of the recitation of Vedic mantras is also included in the austerities of speech. The progenitor, Manu, wrote:satyaṁ brūyāt priyaṁ brūyān na brūyāt satyam apriyampriyaṁ cha nānṛitaṁ brūyād eṣha dharmaḥ sanātanaḥ(Manu Smṛiti 4.138)[v4]“Speak the truth in such a way that it is pleasing to others. Do not speak the truth in a manner injurious to others. Never speak untruth, though it may be pleasant. This is the eternal path of morality and dharma.”
