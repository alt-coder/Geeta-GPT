Transliteration:
abhisandhāya tu phalaṁ dambhārtham api chaiva yatijyate bharata-śhreṣhṭha taṁ yajñaṁ viddhi rājasam

Translation:
BG 17.12:
                            O best of the Bharatas, know that sacrifice performed for material benefit, or with a hypocritical aim, is in the mode of passion.

Commentary:
Sacrifice becomes a form of business with God if it is performed with great pomp and show, but the spirit behind it is one of selfishness i.e., “What will I get in return?” Pure devotion is that where one seeks nothing in return. Shree Krishna says that sacrifice may be done with great ceremony, but if it is for the sake of rewards in the form of prestige, aggrandizement, etc. it is rājasic in nature.
