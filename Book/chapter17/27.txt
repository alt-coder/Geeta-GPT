Translation:
BG 17.26-27:
                            The word “Sat” means eternal existence and goodness. O Arjun, it is also used to describe an auspicious action. Being established in the performance of sacrifice, penance, and charity, is also described by the word “Sat.” And so any act for such purposes is named “Sat.”

Commentary:
Now the auspiciousness of the word “Sat” is being glorified by Shree Krishna. This word Sat has many connotations, and the above two verses describe some of these. Sat is used to mean perpetual goodness and virtue. In addition, auspicious performance of sacrifice, austerity, and charity is also described as Sat. Sat also means that which always exists i.e., it is an eternal truth. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states:
satya-vrataṁ satya-paraṁ tri-satyaṁ satyasya yoniṁ nihitaṁ cha satye satyasya satyam ṛita-satya-netraṁ satyātmakaṁ tvāṁ śharaṇaṁ prapannāḥ (10.2.26)[v8]
“O Lord, your vow is true, for not only are you the Supreme Truth, but you are also the truth in the three phases of the cosmic manifestation—creation, maintenance, and dissolution. You are the origin of all that is true, and you are also its end. You are the essence of all truth, and you are also the eyes by which the truth is seen. Therefore, we surrender unto you, the Sat i.e., Supreme Absolute Truth. Kindly give us protection.”
