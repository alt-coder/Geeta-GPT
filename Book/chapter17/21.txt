Transliteration:
yat tu pratyupakārārthaṁ phalam uddiśhya vā punaḥdīyate cha parikliṣhṭaṁ tad dānaṁ rājasaṁ smṛitam

Translation:
BG 17.21:
                            But charity given with reluctance, with the hope of a return or in expectation of a reward, is said to be in the mode of passion.

Commentary:
The best attitude of charity is to give without even being asked to do so. The second-best attitude is to give happily upon being requested for it. The third-best sentiment of charity is to give begrudgingly, having being asked for a donation, or to regret later, “Why did I give so much? I could have gotten away with a smaller amount.” Shree Krishna classifies this kind of charity in the mode of passion.
