Transliteration:
adeśha-kāle yad dānam apātrebhyaśh cha dīyateasat-kṛitam avajñātaṁ tat tāmasam udāhṛitam

Translation:
BG 17.22:
                            And that charity, which is given at the wrong place and wrong time to unworthy persons, without showing respect, or with contempt, is held to be of the nature of nescience.

Commentary:
Charity in the mode of ignorance is done without consideration of proper place, person, attitude, or time. No beneficial purpose is served by it. For example, if money is offered to an alcoholic, who uses it to get inebriated, and then ends up committing a murder, the murderer will definitely be punished according to the law of karma, but the person who gave the charity will also be culpable for the offence. This is an example of charity in the mode of ignorance that is given to an undeserving person.
