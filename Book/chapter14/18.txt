ūrdhvaṁ gachchhanti sattva-sthā madhye tiṣhṭhanti rājasāḥjaghanya-guṇa-vṛitti-sthā adho gachchhanti tāmasāḥ

Translation:
BG 14.18:
                            Those situated in the mode of goodness rise upward; those in the mode of passion stay in the middle; and those in the mode of ignorance go downward.

Commentary:
Shree Krishna explains that the reincarnation of the souls in their next birth is linked to the guṇas that predominates their personality. Upon completion of their sojourn in the present life, the souls reach the kind of place that corresponds to their guṇas. This can be compared to students applying for college admission after completing school. There are many colleges in the country. Those students with good qualifying criteria at the school level gain admission in the best colleges, while those with poor grades and other scores are admitted to the worst ones. Likewise, the Bhāgavatam says:sattve pralīnāḥ svar yānti nara-lokaṁ rajo-layāḥtamo-layās tu nirayaṁ yānti mām eva nirguṇāḥ (11.25.22)[v2]“Those who are in sattva guṇa reach the higher celestial abodes; those who are in rajo guṇa return to the earth planet; and those who are in tamo guṇa go to the nether worlds; while those who are transcendental to the three modes attain Me.”
