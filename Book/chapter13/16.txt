Translation:
BG 13.16:
                            He exists outside and inside all living beings, those that are moving and not moving.  He is subtle, and hence, He is incomprehensible.  He is very far, but He is also very near.

Commentary:
There is a Vedic Mantra that describes God in practically the same manner as Shree Krishna has described here:tad ejati tan naijati taddūre tadvantiketad antar asya sarvasya tadusarvasyāsya bāhyataḥ   (Īśhopaniṣhad mantra 5)  “The Supreme Brahman does not walk, and yet He walks; He is far, but He is also near.  He exists inside everything, but He is also outside everything.” Previously in verse 13.3, Shree Krishna said that to know God is true knowledge.   However, here He states that the Supreme Entity is incomprehensible.  This again seems to be a contradiction, but what He means is that God is not knowable by the senses, mind, and intellect.  The intellect is made from the material energy, so it cannot reach God who is Divine.  However, if God Himself bestows His grace upon someone, that fortunate soul can come to know Him.
