Translation:
BG 13.4:
                            Listen and I will explain to you what that field is and what its nature is.  I will also explain how change takes place within it, from what it was created, who the knower of the field of activities is, and what his powers are.

Commentary:
Shree Krishna now poses many questions Himself, and asks Arjun to listen carefully to their answers.
