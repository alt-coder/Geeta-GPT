Translation:
BG 13.34:
                            Just as one sun illumines the entire solar system, so does the individual soul illumine the entire body (with consciousness).

Commentary:
Although the soul energizes the entire body in which it is present with consciousness, yet by itself, it is exceedingly small.  eṣho ’ṇurātmā  (Muṇḍakopaniṣhad 3.1.9) “The soul is very tiny in size.”  The Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad states:bālāgraśhatabhāgasya śhatadhā kalpitasya chabhāgo jīvaḥ sa vijñeyaḥ sa chānantyāya kalpate   (5.9)“If we divide the tip of a hair into a hundred parts, and then divide each part into further hundred parts, we will get the size of the soul.  These souls are innumerable in number.”  This is a manner of expressing the minuteness of the soul. How can such an infinitesimal soul energize the body, which is huge in comparison?   Shree Krishna explains this with the analogy of the sun.  Although situated in one place, the sun illumines the entire solar system with its light.  Likewise, the Vedānt Darśhan states:guṇādvā lokavat   (2.3.25)  “The soul, although seated in the heart spreads its consciousness throughout the field of the body.”
