Translation:
BG 9.33:
                            What then to speak about kings and sages with meritorious deeds?  Therefore, having come to this transient and joyless world, engage in devotion unto Me.

Commentary:
When even the most abominable sinners are assured of success on the path of bhakti, then why should more qualified souls have any doubt?  Kings and sages should be even more reassured of attaining the supreme destination by engaging in ananya bhakti (exclusive devotion).  Shree Krishna thus beckons Arjun, “A saintly king like you should become situated in the knowledge that the world is temporary and a place of misery.  Engage yourself in steadfast devotion to Me, the possessor of unlimited eternal happiness.  Else the blessing of birth in a kingly and saintly family, good education, and favorable material circumstances will all be wasted, if they are not utilized in the pursuit of the supreme goal.”
