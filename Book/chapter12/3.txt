Translation:
BG 12.3-4:
                            But those who worship the formless aspect of the Absolute Truth—the imperishable, the indefinable, the unmanifest, the all-pervading, the unthinkable, the unchanging, the eternal, and the immoveable—by restraining their senses and being even-minded everywhere, such persons, engaged in the welfare of all beings, also attain Me.

Commentary:
Having said that worship of the personal form is the best, Shree Krishna clarifies that in no way does He reject the worship of the formless.  Those who devote themselves to the all-pervading, indefinable, unmanifest, inconceivable, immovable, eternal Brahman, also attain God. Living beings are of an infinite variety of natures.  The Supreme Lord who has created this variety also possesses an infinite variety of aspects to His personality.  For the sake of our finite comprehension, we classify the infinite manifestations of God into categories.  Accordingly, Ved Vyas has classified God’s various manifestations into three types, Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavān, as mentioned in the commentary of the previous verse.  One may worship either of these categories, but one should never claim that one’s conception of God is the only correct one while those of the others are erroneous. In verse 4.11, Shree Krishna had stated: “In whatever way people surrender unto Me, I reciprocate accordingly. Everyone follows My path, knowingly or unknowingly, O son of Pritha.”  Here, Shree Krishna confirms that the worshippers of the formless also reach Him.  Since their choice is to unite with the attributeless manifestation of the Supreme Absolute Truth, God meets them as the unmanifest, all-pervading Brahman.
