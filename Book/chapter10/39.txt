Transliteration:
yach chāpi sarva-bhūtānāṁ bījaṁ tad aham arjunana tad asti vinā yat syān mayā bhūtaṁ charācharam

Translation:
BG 10.39:
                            I am the generating seed of all living beings, O Arjun. No creature moving or non-moving can exist without Me.

Commentary:
Shree Krishna is both the efficient cause of all creation and also the material cause. Efficient cause means that he is the creator who performs the work involved in manifesting the world. Material cause means that he is the material from which creation happens. In verses 7.10 and 9.18, Shree Krishna declared himself as “the eternal seed.” Again here, he states that he is “the generating seed.” He is stressing that he is the origin of everything, and without his potency nothing can exist.Living beings are born in four ways: Aṇḍaj—born from eggs, such as birds, snakes, and lizards; Jarāyuj—born from the womb, such as humans, cows, dogs, and cats; Swedaj—born from sweat, such as lice, ticks, etc; Udbhij—sprouting from the earth, such as trees, creepers, grass, and corn. There are also other life forms, such as ghosts, evil spirits, manes, etc. Shree Krishna is the origin of all of them.
