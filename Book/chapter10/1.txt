Translation:
BG 10.1:
                            The Lord said: Listen again to My divine teachings, O mighty armed one. Desiring your welfare because you are My beloved friend, I shall reveal them to you.

Commentary:
Shree Krishna is delighted with Arjun’s keen interest in hearing his glories. Now, to further enhance his joy and fan his enthusiasm for loving devotion, Shree Krishna declares that he will narrate his sublime glories and incomparable attributes. He uses the words te prīyamāṇāya, implying “You are my beloved confidant, and so I am revealing this very special knowledge to you.”
