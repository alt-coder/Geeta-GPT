Transliteration:
yad yad vibhūtimat sattvaṁ śhrīmad ūrjitam eva vātat tad evāvagachchha tvaṁ mama tejo ’nśha-sambhavam

Translation:
BG 10.41:
                            Whatever you see as beautiful, glorious, or powerful, know it to spring from but a spark of My splendor.

Commentary:
Electricity flowing through a speaker creates sound, but one who does not know the principle behind how it works may think that the sound comes from the speaker itself. Similarly, whenever we observe extraordinary splendor anywhere, whatever catches our imagination, sends us in raptures, and infuses us with bliss, we should know it to be but a spark of the glory of God. He is the infinite reservoir of beauty, glory, power, knowledge, and opulence. He is the powerhouse from where all beings and things get their splendor. Thus, we must make God, who is the source of all glory, the object of our worship.
