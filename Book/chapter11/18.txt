Translation:
BG 11.18:
                            I recognize You as the supreme imperishable being, the Ultimate Truth to be known by the scriptures. You are the support of all creation; You are the eternal protector of Sanātan Dharma (the Eternal Religion); and You are the everlasting Supreme Divine Personality.

Commentary:
Arjun announced that he recognized the sovereignty of Shree Krishna’s position as the Supreme Lord, who is the support of all creation, and who is to be known through all the scriptures. The Kaṭhopaniṣhad states:sarve vedā yat padamāmananti (1.2.15)[v2]“The aim of all the Vedic mantras is to take us in the direction of God. He is the object of the study of the Vedas.” The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states:vāsudeva-parā vedā vāsudeva-parā makhāḥ  (1.2.28)[v3]“The goal of cultivating Vedic knowledge is to reach God. All sacrifices are also meant for pleasing him.” In his tribute to Shree Krishna, Arjun expressed his realization that the personal form of the Lord, standing before him, was the same supreme absolute truth that is the object of all Vedic knowledge.
