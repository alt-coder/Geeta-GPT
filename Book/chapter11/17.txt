Translation:
BG 11.17:
                            I see Your form, adorned with a crown, and armed with the club and disc, shining everywhere as the abode of splendor. It is hard to look upon You in the blazing fire of Your effulgence, which is radiating like the sun in all directions.

Commentary:
Physical eyes get blinded upon seeing something very bright. The cosmic form before Arjun had a brilliance that exceeded thousands of blazing suns. As the sun dazzles the eyes, the universal form was immensely stunning to the eyes. He was able to behold it only because he had received divine eyes from the Lord.Within the universal form, Arjun also perceived the four-armed Vishnu form of the Lord, with the four famous emblems—mace, conch, disc, and lotus flower.
