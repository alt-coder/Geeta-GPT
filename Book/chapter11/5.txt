Translation:
BG 11.5:
                            The Supreme Lord said: Behold, O Parth, My hundreds and thousands of wonderful forms of various shapes, sizes, and colors.

Commentary:
After listening to Arjun’s prayers, Shree Krishna now asks him to have a vision of his viśhwarūp, or universal form. He uses the word paśhya, meaning “behold” to indicate that Arjun must pay attention. Although the form is one, it has unlimited features, and contains innumerable personalities of multitude shapes and variegated colors. Shree Krishna uses the phrase śhataśho ’tha sahasraśhaḥ to indicate they exist in innumerable fashions and multitude ways.Having asked Arjun to behold his universal form with infinite shapes and colors, Shree Krishna now asks Arjun to observe the celestial gods and other wonders in that cosmic form.
