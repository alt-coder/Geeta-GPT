Translation:
BG 11.49:
                            Be neither afraid nor bewildered on seeing this terrible form of Mine. Be free from fear and with a cheerful heart, behold Me once again in My personal form.

Commentary:
Shree Krishna continues to pacify Arjun that rather than being scared, he should feel privileged to be blessed with a vision of the cosmic form. Further, he tells Arjun to behold his personal form again and shed his fear.
