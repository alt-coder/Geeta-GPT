Translation:
BG 11.15:
                            Arjun said: O Shree Krishna, I behold within Your body all the gods and hosts of different beings. I see Brahma seated on the lotus flower; I see Shiv, all the sages, and the celestial serpents.

Commentary:
Arjun exclaimed that he was beholding multitudes of beings from all the three worlds, including the gods of the celestial abodes. The words kamalāsanasatham refer to Lord Brahma, who sits at the lotus whorl of the universe. Lord Shiv, sages like Vishwamitra, and serpents such as Vasuki were all visible within the cosmic form.
