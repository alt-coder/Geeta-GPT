Translation:
BG 11.16:
                            I see Your infinite form in every direction, with countless arms, stomachs, faces, and eyes. O Lord of the universe, whose form is the universe itself, I do not see in You any beginning, middle, or end.

Commentary:
Arjun uses two vocatives—viśhweśhwar, meaning “controller of the universe” and viśhwarūp, meaning “universal form.” He implies, “O Shree Krishna, the universe is nothing but your manifestation and you are also its supreme master.” Further, he expresses the vastness of the form he is experiencing, by saying that from whichever angle he looks, Arjun cannot discern any end to his manifestations. When he searches for the beginning, he is unable to find it. When he tries to see its middle, he again gets no success, and when he searches for the end, he can find no limit to the panorama manifesting before him.
