Translation:
BG 11.28-29:
                            As many waves of the rivers flowing rapidly into the ocean, so are all these great warriors entering into Your blazing mouths. As moths rush with great speed into the fire to perish, so are all these armies entering with great speed into Your mouths.

Commentary:
There were many noble kings and warriors in the war, who fought as their duty and laid down their lives on the battlefield. Arjun compares them to river waves willingly merging into the ocean. There were also many others, who fought out of greed and self-interest. Arjun compares them with moths being lured ignorantly into the incinerating fire. But in both cases, they are marching rapidly toward their imminent death.
