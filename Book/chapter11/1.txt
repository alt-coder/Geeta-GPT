BG 11.1:
                            Arjun said: Having heard the supremely confidential spiritual knowledge, which You have revealed out of compassion for me, my illusion is now dispelled.

Commentary:
Arjun has rejoiced upon hearing Shree Krishna’s vibhūtis, as well as knowledge about the Supreme Personality, and he feels that his illusion is now dispelled. He has accepted that Shree Krishna is not merely his best friend, but also the Supreme Divine Personality, who is the source of all opulence in the world. Now in this chapter, he begins by gratefully acknowledging Shree Krishna’s compassion in revealing such invaluable knowledge.
