Translation:
BG 11.23:
                            O mighty Lord, in veneration of Your magnificent form with its many mouths, eyes, arms, thighs, legs, stomachs, and terrifying teeth, all the worlds are terror-stricken, and so am I.

Commentary:
The numerous hands, legs, faces, and stomach of God are everywhere. The Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad states:sahasraśhīrṣhā puruṣhaḥ sahasrākṣhaḥ sahasrapātsa bhūmiṁ viśhwato vṛitvātyatiṣhṭhaddaśhāṅgulam (3.14)[v5]“The Supreme Entity has thousands of heads, thousands of eyes, and thousands of feet. He envelopes the universe, but is transcendental to it. He resides in all humans, about ten fingers above the navel, in the lotus of the heart.” Those who are beholding and those who are being beheld, the terrified and the terrifying, are all within the universal form of the Lord. Again, the Kaṭhopaniṣhad states:bhayādasyāgnistapati bhayāt tapati sūryaḥbhayādindraśhcha vāyuśhcha mṛityurdhāvati pañchamaḥ (2.3.3)[v6]“It is from the fear of God that the fire burns and the sun shines. It is out of fear of him that the wind blows and Indra causes the rain to fall. Even Yamraj, the god of death, trembles before him.”
