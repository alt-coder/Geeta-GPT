ākhyāhi me ko bhavān ugra-rūponamo ’stu te deva-vara prasīdavijñātum ichchhāmi bhavantam ādyaṁna hi prajānāmi tava pravṛittim

Translation:
BG 11.31:
                            Tell me who You are, so fierce of form. O God of gods, I bow before You; please bestow Your mercy on me. You, who existed before all creation, I wish to know who You are, for I do not comprehend Your nature and workings.

Commentary:
Earlier, Arjun had requested to see the universal form. When Shree Krishna exhibited it, Arjun became bewildered and agitated. Having witnessed an almost unbelievable cosmic spectacle, he now wants to know the very heart of God’s nature and purpose. Hence, he asks the question, “Who are you and what is your purpose?”
