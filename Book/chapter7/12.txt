Translation:
BG 7.12:
                            The three states of material existence—goodness, passion, and ignorance—are manifested by My energy. They are in Me, but I am beyond them.

Commentary:
In this verse, Shree Krishna sums up His glories that He had described in the previous four verses. He says, “Arjun, I have explained how I am the essence of all objects.  But there is no point in going into detail.  All good-bad and ugly objects and states of existence are made possible only by My energy.”Even though the entire creation originates from God, He is beyond His creation and independent of it. A famous poet Alfred Tennyson stated in his poem “In Memorium:”Our little systems have their day;They have their day and cease to be.They are but broken lights of thee,And thou, O Lord, art more than they.
