Transliteration:
sa tayā śhraddhayā yuktas tasyārādhanam īhatelabhate cha tataḥ kāmān mayaiva vihitān hi tān

Translation:
BG 7.22:
                            Endowed with faith, the devotee worships a particular celestial god and obtains the objects of desire. But in reality, I alone arrange these benefits.

Commentary:
Shree Krishna reiterates in this verse that the celestial gods do not have the capacity to fulfill the material desires of their devotees. They can only grant wishes if God permits it. Labhate means “to obtain.” The devotees with mediocre understanding may think that they have obtained their desired material objects by pleasing the devatās (celestial gods). However, it is not the devatās, but God who facilitates everything.
