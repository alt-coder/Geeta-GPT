Transliteration:
puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛithivyāṁ cha tejaśh chāsmi vibhāvasaujīvanaṁ sarva-bhūteṣhu tapaśh chāsmi tapasviṣhu

Translation:
BG 7.9:
                            I am the pure fragrance of the Earth, and the brilliance in fire. I am the life-force in all beings, and the penance of the ascetics.

Commentary:
In continuation to the previous verses, Shree Krishna declares that He is the source and the most vital ingredient of everything. The entire universe is an extension of His opulence. On Earth, He is the force behind both the non-living and the living. He is the mild and pure fragrance of the earth and the bright radiance of a flame. He is the life-force of all living creatures. The ascetics or sadhus consciously deny themselves of bodily pleasures and perform austerities for self-purification. Lord Krishna says He is indeed the force behind their capacity to do penance.
