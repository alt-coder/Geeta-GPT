Translation:
BG 7.1:
                            The Supreme Lord said: Now listen, O Arjun, how, with the mind attached exclusively to Me, and surrendering to Me through the practice of bhakti yog, you can know Me completely, free from doubt.

Commentary:
While concluding the previous chapter, Shree Krishna stated that the best yogis are those who exclusively focus on God and serve Him with great dedication. This gives rise to a few questions, such as, how can one get to know the Supreme Lord? How should a devotee worship Him and meditate upon Him?Although Arjun had not asked these questions, yet the Omniscient and kind Lord began to answer. Here, Shree Krishna has used the terms mad-āśhrayaḥ, meaning “with your mind focused on Me” and śhṛiṇu, which means “listen.” He is asking Arjun to listen to Him attentively.
