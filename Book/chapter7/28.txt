Translation:
BG 7.28:
                            But persons, whose sins have been destroyed by engaging in pious activities, become free from the illusion of dualities. Such persons worship Me with determination.

Commentary:
Shree Krishna says that those souls who have freed their minds from the dualities of hatred and desire worship him with unshakeable determination. They neither seek pleasure in the material world nor feel an aversion for pain. They are cautious while indulging in worldly pleasures as it may again delude their soul. Earlier, in verse 2.69, Shree Krishna had said, “What the ignorant consider as night, the wise consider as day.” Such devotees, who aspire to attain God-realization, look upon adversities as an opportunity for spiritual growth and renunciation.
