BG 8.21:
                            That unmanifest dimension is the supreme goal, and upon reaching it, one never returns to this mortal world.  That is My Supreme Abode.

Commentary:
The spiritual realm has a divine sky called the Paravyom, where all the different forms of God have their eternal abodes called the Lokas. The Supreme Lord resides in His various divine forms in these Lokas along with His eternal associates. Golok is the divine abode of Lord Krishna, Saket Lok is the abode of Lord Ram, Vaikunth Lok is the abode of Lord Vishnu, Shiv Lok is the abode of Lord Shiv, Devi Lok is the abode of Divine Mother Durga, etc. These divine forms are non-different from the Supreme Lord; they are all divine forms of the same one God. A devotee may worship any of the forms of God and strive to attain Him. Once God-realized, their soul will reach the divine Lok of that form of God and remain there forever. It receives a divine body and participates in the divine pastimes and activities of the Lord.
