Translation:
BG 16.18:
                            Blinded by egotism, strength, arrogance, desire, and anger, the demonic abuse Me, who am present in their own body and in the bodies of others.

Commentary:
Here, Shree Krishna describes more telltale signs of people possessing demoniac natures. They are vile, malicious, cruel, belligerent, and insolent. Although they do not possess righteous qualities themselves, they enjoy finding fault in everyone else. They consider themselves all-important, and as a consequence of this nature of self-aggrandizement, they are envious of other’s success. If ever they are opposed in their schemes, they become enraged and cause agony to others as well as to their own selves. Consequently, they disregard and disrespect the Supreme Soul who is seated within their own hearts and the hearts of others.
